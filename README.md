> 🚀 A step towards Ecommerce Functionalities in terms of APS

An e-commerce website is one that allows people to buy and sell physical goods, services, and digital products over the internet rather than at a brick-and-mortar location. Through an e-commerce website, a business can process orders, accept payments, manage shipping and logistics, and provide customer service [[1](https://mailchimp.com/marketing-glossary/ecommerce-website/#:~:text=An%20e%2Dcommerce%20website%20is,logistics%2C%20and%20provide%20customer%20service)].

In this portfolio, I am trying to express the basic functionalities of an e-commerce website in terms of algorithms.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this portfolio is to bridge the gap between theoretical algorithms and their practical applications in the e-commerce domain. By understanding and implementing various algorithms, this portfolio aims to showcase how algorithmic solutions can significantly enhance the efficiency and functionality of e-commerce websites.

## Objectives
- To explore and implement a range of algorithms relevant to e-commerce functionalities.
- To provide a detailed analysis of each algorithm's complexity and performance.
- To demonstrate the practical application of algorithms in solving real-world e-commerce problems.
- To create a comprehensive resource that maps e-commerce functionalities to appropriate algorithmic solutions.
